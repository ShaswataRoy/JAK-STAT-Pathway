The simulations of the ODE model were performed in Matlab R2020b. The following files were attached to the publication:
- model.m - mathematical model described by ordinary differential equations (ODE).
- parameters.m - ODE model parameters and initial conditions.
- main.m - main file that enables simulation of the ODE model. 

In order to simulate the model, unpack all files in one location and run the main.m file. 
Various IFN doses and pulse times can be simulated by changing parameters in the section "Simulation time points" of main.m file (details in the code comments).
